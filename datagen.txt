Title: 
Synthetic Data Generator

1. Abstract:

Synthetic market data timeseries may be used for training automated trading agents. Since historical training data is limited, 
this document proposes the design of a system for generaring synthetic data by using an intermediate layer of financial events
timeseries that can be used to generate synthetic market data timeseries on which trading agents can be trained.

The financial events outcomes timeseries are extracted from the news using LLM(Large Language Model) technology, to be used
on live trading and during validation of an automated trading agent, while this event outcomes can be randomized under certain constraints
to generate synthetic market timeseries for agent training.

This project evaluates the suitability of this approach for automated trading agents training, and compares it with other 
synthetic data generation techniques for the same purpose.

2. Introduction:

The limited quantity of historical market data for a financial asset may be a limitation for the process of training
automated training agents, many techniques allow to generate new data using feature engineering or other thecniques, 
but an unlimited quantity of data that can be generated at will and that behaves reallistically, is desirable to avoid 
overfitting. 

In this document, the design of a system is presented, its function is to generate
synthetic data tailored for the training of an automated trading agent. In the approch used here, this data generation 
process involves two  
different components: financial timeseries generator from financial calendar events, and financial calendar 
events timeseries generator from parsed news sources using a LLM (Large Language Model). 

The financial calendar events generator component, allows to use the events as an intermediate layer of information
that can be used to generate timeseries data that can be used to train an automated trading agent.

The objective of this project is to evaluate the suitability of this intermediate layer in generating synthetic market data
from randomized financial event outcomes. The measurement of this suitability is made by testing with real data the
the following 3 automated training agents: 
- one trained with only real data
- a second one trained with synthetic data using the proposed approach
- a third one trained with synthetic data generated with state-of-the-art techniques.

Since the configuration of both components and the trading agent
optimization processes are suceptible to affect the suitability of this technique, the system to make the tests 
has a flexible and configurable software architecture.

This system has plugin-based architecture, which allows for configurable news sources and 
financial calendar scraping and parsing methods.

The unique aspect of this system lies in its objective not to replicate a timeseries exactly, but to capture and emulate 
its general behavior. This approach ensures that the trading agent operates within realistic simulations during 
reinforcement learning training, 
offering an environment that closely mimics the complexities of real-world financial markets.

Central to this system's development is the implementation of a robust test-driven methodology, which will be applied 
rigorously from the initial design phase to the final implementation. This system's development process 
will be partly automated or assisted by state-of-the-art AI coding and documentation tools. This commitment to the 
test-driven development methodology and AI-assisted development ensures acceptable levels of quality in all phases of 
the project, looking to obtain shorter development times, better documentation, lower total costs and less bugs or delays.

3. Objectives 

The general objective is the measurement of the trading efficiency on real data, of an automatic trading agent, that has 
been trained on synthetic data and compare it with: an agent that has been trained only on historical data and one that
uses the state-of-the-art synthetic market data generation for training.

including training data generators, training agents, customizably randomizing the event outcome dataset to produce
