Title: 
Synthetic Data Generator

Abstract:
This document contains the design of a system 
for generaring synthetic data to be used for 
training an automated trading agent. The data 
to be generated is either financial timeseries 
generated from financial calendar events 
timeseries or financial calendar events  
timeseries from LLM parsed news sources.

Introduction:
please make a theoretical framework document, that includes sections and subsections of the topics of knowledge for the behaviour and structure of each component of the system described in the following text:


In this comprehensive document, we present the intricate design of a cutting-edge system engineered with a plug-in based architecture, facilitating flexibility and extensibility. The system's core functionality revolves around generating synthetic data tailored for the training of an automated trading agent. This data generation process involves two essential components: financial timeseries, which are derived from financial calendar events, and financial calendar events timeseries sourced from meticulously parsed news sources using the LLM (Language Model) technology. 

One of the key innovations of this system is its plugin-based architecture, which allows for configurable news sources and financial calendar scraping and parsing methods. This modular design enables users to adapt and customize the system to their specific needs, making it highly versatile.

The unique aspect of this system lies in its objective not to replicate a timeseries exactly, but to capture and emulate its general behavior. This approach ensures that the trading agent operates within realistic simulations, offering a training environment that closely mimics the complexities and nuances of real-world financial markets.

Central to this system's development is the implementation of a robust test-driven methodology, which will be applied rigorously from the initial design phase to the final implementation. Every aspect of this system's development process will be automated or assisted by state-of-the-art AI coding and documentation tools. This commitment to automated testing and AI-driven development ensures the highest levels of reliability, efficiency, and precision in all phases of the project, setting the stage for groundbreaking advancements in the fusion of artificial intelligence with financial data generation and trading agent training, particularly through the plugin-based architecture, which enhances adaptability and functionality.

Doc:
Certainly, here's a theoretical framework document for the system, organized into sections and subsections, detailing the behavior and structure of each component, including the usage of a built-in Python plug-in system:
