Title: 
Synthetic Data Generator

1. Abstract:

Synthetic market data timeseries may be used for training automated trading agents. Since historical training data is limited, 
this document proposes the design of a system for generaring synthetic data by using an intermediate layer of financial events
timeseries that can be used to generate synthetic market data timeseries on which trading agents can be trained.

The financial events outcomes timeseries are extracted from the news using LLM(Large Language Model) technology, to be used
on live trading and during validation of an automated trading agent, while this event outcomes can be randomized under certain constraints
to generate synthetic market timeseries for agent training.

This project evaluates the suitability of this approach for automated trading agents training, and compares it with other 
synthetic data generation techniques for the same purpose.

2. Introduction:

The limited quantity of historical market data for a financial asset may be a limitation for the process of training
automated training agents, many techniques allow to generate new data using feature engineering or other thecniques, 
but an unlimited quantity of data that can be generated at will and that behaves reallistically, is desirable to avoid 
overfitting. 

In this document, the design of a system is presented, its function is to generate
synthetic data tailored for the training of an automated trading agent. In the approch used here, this data generation 
process involves two  
different components: financial timeseries generator from financial calendar events, and financial calendar 
events timeseries generator from parsed news sources using a LLM (Large Language Model). 

The financial calendar events generator component, allows to use the events as an intermediate layer of information
that can be used to generate timeseries data that can be used to train an automated trading agent.

The objective of this project is to evaluate the suitability of this intermediate layer in generating synthetic market data
from randomized financial event outcomes. The measurement of this suitability is made by testing with real data the
the following 3 automated training agents: 
- one trained with only real data
- a second one trained with synthetic data using the proposed approach
- a third one trained with synthetic data generated with state-of-the-art techniques.

Since the configuration of both components and the trading agent
optimization processes are suceptible to affect the suitability of this technique, the system to make the tests 
has a flexible and configurable software architecture.

This system has plugin-based architecture, which allows for configurable news sources and 
financial calendar scraping and parsing methods.

The unique aspect of this system lies in its objective not to replicate a timeseries exactly, but to capture and emulate 
its general behavior. This approach ensures that the trading agent operates within realistic simulations during 
reinforcement learning training, 
offering an environment that closely mimics the complexities and nuances of real-world financial markets.

Central to this system's development is the implementation of a robust test-driven methodology, which will be applied 
rigorously from the initial design phase to the final implementation. Every aspect of this system's development process 
will be automated or assisted by state-of-the-art AI coding and documentation tools. This commitment to automated testing 
and AI-driven development ensures the highest levels of reliability, efficiency, and precision in all phases of the project, 
setting the stage for quality software, shorter development times, lower total costs and less bugs or delays during measurements.

3. Objectives 

The general objective is the measurement of the trading efficiency on real data, of an automatic trading agent, that has 
been trained on synthetic data and compare it with: an agent that has been trained only on historical data and one that
uses the state-of-the-art synthetic market data generation for training.

In sections 3.1 to 3.3, the specific objectives are described.
3.1 To design and implement the components described in subsections 3.1.1 to 3.1.5.
3.1.1 Financial news scrapper and parser.
3.1.2 Financial calendar events scrapper and parser.
3.1.3 Synthetic market data generator from calendar event outcomes.

3.1.5 Trading efficiency measurements and comparisons with state-of-the-art synthetic data generators.
3.2 To use the test-driven development during the design and implementation of the whole system.
3.3 To use state-of the-art AI tools during design and implementation for: documentation, code, tests and automation tasks.

4. Scope
Make a software and tests but only using reinforcement learning and compare with similar data generators using the same techniques.
