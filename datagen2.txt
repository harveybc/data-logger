Title: 
Synthetic Data Generator

1. Abstract:

This document delineates the comprehensive framework and operational paradigm of a Synthetic Data Generator system, specifically conceptualized for the financial sector's unique requirements. The cornerstone of this system lies in its innovative use of Large Language Model (LLM) technology, which is intricately employed for parsing financial news and subsequent generation of financial events. These events form the basis for the creation of synthetic market timeseries, a pivotal element in the system's functionality.

Central to the system is the Trader Interface, meticulously crafted to facilitate the simulation of trading strategies, leveraging automated agents. These agents are uniquely trained on an integration of both real and synthetic data, providing a versatile and dynamic platform for strategy optimization. This novel approach primarily aims to enhance the agents' adaptability and performance in scenarios that closely emulate the complex nature of real-world financial markets.

This system's design is underpinned by a robust, test-driven development methodology, bolstered by AI-assisted coding and documentation tools. This strategic approach ensures not only high-quality development but also efficient testing phases and optimized resource utilization. The architecture is scalable and flexible, adept at handling varying loads and accommodating functional updates seamlessly. A key emphasis is placed on user experience, with the system offering an intuitive and efficient environment for both traders and data scientists, thereby facilitating comprehensive strategy simulations and analyses.


2. Introduction:

The limited quantity of historical market data for a financial asset may be a limitation for the process of training
automated training agents, many techniques allow to generate new data using feature engineering or other thecniques, 
but an unlimited quantity of data that can be generated at will and that behaves reallistically, is desirable to avoid 
overfitting. 

In this document, the design of a system is presented, its function is to generate
synthetic data tailored for the training of an automated trading agent. In the approch used here, this data generation 
process involves two  
different components: financial timeseries generator from financial calendar events, and financial calendar 
events timeseries generator from parsed news sources using a LLM (Large Language Model). 

The financial calendar events generator component, allows to use the events as an intermediate layer of information
that can be used to generate timeseries data that can be used to train an automated trading agent.

The objective of this project is to evaluate the suitability of this intermediate layer in generating synthetic market data
from randomized financial event outcomes. The measurement of this suitability is made by testing with real data the
the following 3 automated training agents: 
- one trained with only real data
- a second one trained with synthetic data using the proposed approach
- a third one trained with synthetic data generated with state-of-the-art techniques.

Since the configuration of both components and the trading agent
optimization processes are suceptible to affect the suitability of this technique, the system to make the tests 
has a flexible and configurable software architecture.

This system has plugin-based architecture, which allows for configurable news sources and 
financial calendar scraping and parsing methods.

The unique aspect of this system lies in its objective not to replicate a timeseries exactly, but to capture and emulate 
its general behavior. This approach ensures that the trading agent operates within realistic simulations during 
reinforcement learning training, 
offering an environment that closely mimics the complexities of real-world financial markets.

Central to this system's development is the implementation of a robust test-driven methodology, which will be applied 
rigorously from the initial design phase to the final implementation. This system's development process 
will be partly automated or assisted by state-of-the-art AI coding and documentation tools. This commitment to the 
test-driven development methodology and AI-assisted development ensures acceptable levels of quality in all phases of 
the project, looking to obtain shorter development times, better documentation, lower total costs and less bugs or delays.

3. Objectives
